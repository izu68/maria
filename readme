		an extremely experimental Mega Drive emulator, just for my
		own testing and development. it's forked off kiwi and based
		on the MUSASHI m68k portable emulator written in C.

		as of now, it's pretty much identical to kiwi, simply replaced
		the python frontend with a frontend written in C that uses
		the raylib graphics and input framework. Its main purpose is to
		develop an emulation framework for EVA, an expansion module I'm
		designing for mega drive systems.

		***************************************************************
	
					supported:

				   m68k core, z80 core
				  H40 and H32 VDP modes
			       all forms of VDP scrolling
			 3 Button controllers ( PORT 1 & PORT 2 )

				       unsupported:

			      audio: both YM2612 and SN76489
				       ROM banking

		***************************************************************

			     key combos and controller mapping

				  tab: pulse reset m68k
				option + tab: reload ROM
	
			   WASD: DPAD up, down, left and right
				     JKL: A, B and C

					   notes

		the build system and compilation instructions are set up for mac,
		the raylib library in lib is compiled for mac and such as it is
		will not work on any OS. if you wanna try this out recompile
		raylib and change the build system to accomodate for another
		compiler and settings. The inspector window for monitoring 68K and 
 		EVA processes is rendered using the Metal graphics framework, and
  		thus, won't work outside of mac computers at all.
